## Drawing on the Web - Final Project
### Software: 
All but the first navigation page will use THREE.js
### Structure  
- Initial page provides navigation to  
	- Past 
	- Present 
	- Future
	- Added to it an animation and ominous sound for better UX
### Experience:
- Page 1 / Past: Represent’s one past and fading memories on top of a spiral. Blocks pop and then and vanish. It will have an avatar placed in the center where other objects are orbiting. Background structure is visible but out of plane.
The box containing the plane has 5 sides, including plane, and the open side shows the far structure in the background.
- Page 2 / Present: Background structure shown far in page 1 is rendered in 3D environment where some images hide behind other images and depending on where the user is positioned it will have different perspectives. Similar to Assignment 5 where I had the masks behind a door.
This box for this one has 4 sides, including plane, and from far one can see little structures in two opposite sides of the box's horizon but they are not discernible, just blocks from afar, one side is blue (past) and the other is red (future).
- Page 3 / Future: Also a 3D environment where I want to play with shadows of objects to represent anxieties and projections that don’t necessarily represent reality. This box has all sides, and they keep approaching and returning to it's original position.
